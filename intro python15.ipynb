    "Last lesson we learned that there are a lot of questions to consider when you first look at a data set, including whether you should clean or transform the data. We touched briefly on a few basic operations to prepare data for analysis, but the Titanic data set was pretty clean to begin with. Data you encounter in the wild won't always be so friendly. Text data in particular can be extremely messy and difficult to work with because it can contain all sorts of characters and symbols that may have little meaning for your analysis. This lesson will cover some basic techniques and functions for working with text data in Python.\n",

    "To start off we'll need some text data that is a little messier than the names in the Titanic data set. As it happens, Kaggle launched a data exploration competition recently, giving users access to a database of comments made on Reddit.com during the month of May 2015. Since the Minnesota Timberwolves are my favorite basketball team, I extracted the comments from the team's fan subreddit from the database. You can get the data file (comments.csv) here.\n",

A regular expression or regex is a sequence of characters and special meta characters used to match a set of character strings. Regular expressions allow you to be more expressive with string matching operations than just providing a simple substring. A regular expression lets you define a \"pattern\" that can match strings of different lengths, made up of different characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the str.contains() example above, we supplied the regular expression: \"wigg|drew\". In this case, the vertical bar | is a metacharacter that acts as the \"or\" operator, so this regular expression matches any string that contains the substring \"wigg\" or \"drew\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When you provide a regular expression that contains no metacharacters, it simply matches the exact substring. For instance, \"Wiggins\" would only match strings containing the exact substring \"Wiggins.\" Metacharacters let you change how you make matches. Here is a list of basic metacharacters and what they do:"
